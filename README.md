# Image Processing with Python

This project demonstrates basic image processing using Python with OpenCV and Matplotlib. The script loads an image, converts it to grayscale, applies edge detection using the Canny algorithm, and saves the processed images.

## Project Overview

The project performs the following tasks:
1. **Load an image**: The script loads an image from the provided path.
2. **Convert to Grayscale**: The image is converted to grayscale for further processing.
3. **Edge Detection**: The Canny edge detection algorithm is applied to detect edges in the image.
4. **Display Images**: The original, grayscale, and edge-detected images are displayed.
5. **Save Processed Images**: The grayscale and edge-detected images are saved to disk.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
